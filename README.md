## 🧱 Modules Overview

### [🛠️ Prerequisites](./airdrop)
A set of initial coding tasks and setup steps completed during the application phase. It lays the groundwork for deeper Solana and Anchor work.

### [⚙️ Solana Basics](./solana-starter)
My first step into Solana development—learning how programs interact with accounts, deploying to Devnet, and understanding Solana’s programming model using native CLI.

### [🔒 Anchor Vault System](./anchor_vault)
Built a secure vault program to manage digital asset storage. This project demonstrates how PDAs, program-controlled accounts, and token transfers come together to enforce rules on-chain.

### [🤝 Anchor Escrow Protocol](./anchor_escrow)
Developed an escrow-based contract system to facilitate secure and trustless payments between two parties.

### [🛍️ Anchor Marketplace Engine](./anchor_marketplace)
An exploration into decentralized commerce—created a smart contract marketplace where NFTs and tokens can be listed, purchased, and delisted programmatically.

### [🎨 NFT Staking Module](./nft-staking)
Built a staking system for NFTs, allowing users to lock assets and earn on-chain rewards. Learned how to interface with metadata, verify ownership, and automate reward logic.

### [💧 Automated Market Maker (AMM)](./anchor-amm)
Developed a basic AMM from scratch—enabling users to swap SPL tokens, add liquidity, and simulate trading pools without a central authority.

### [🧾 Pivox Protocol (Capstone)](./PIVOX)
My final capstone project: **Pivox** — a milestone-based freelance payment protocol built with Anchor. It leverages vaults, multi-stage approvals, and contract metadata to create a trustless payment platform for freelancers and clients.
